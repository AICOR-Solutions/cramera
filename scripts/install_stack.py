"""
Install cramera with the CRAM workspace into one virtual environment, so the whole stack
works: the viewer, its plugins, cramera-bridge and every package of the CRAM workspace,
all editable.

``python3 scripts/install_stack.py`` clones the CRAM workspace next to this repository
when it is not there yet, creates the environment with uv and installs everything in one
resolution. ``--viewer-only`` installs the viewer and its plugins without CRAM. The
script needs only the standard library and uv.

A package of the CRAM workspace whose distribution this repository also provides, such
as CRAM's own earlier ``cramera``, is left out, so this repository's package is the one
installed. cramera-bridge is installed from this repository while it lives here, and
from the CRAM workspace once it moved there.
