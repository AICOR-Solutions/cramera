"""
What the CRAM workspace offers a plan: its robot annotations, object meshes, surface
annotations and native actions, as cramera-bridge reads them and hands them over in the
protocol's documents.

Whether the workspace is importable is decided by asking the import system before
anything imports it, so an absent workspace is a value the plugin reads rather than an
import error it has to catch; the module reading the workspace is only imported once
every module is found.
