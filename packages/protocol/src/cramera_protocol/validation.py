"""
Validating a plan before it runs on the robot: every step of the performing robot is
tried in a copy of the twin without moving anything, and the report says of each step
whether it holds, holds on objects only assumed, or fails and why.

A plan runs on the robot only once its latest version passed; a plan edit or a change of
the scene invalidates the report.
