GARMI carries a bowl off the kitchen counter and a spoon out of a drawer to the table of
the apartment, as CRAM's GARMI demonstration (``coraplex/demos/coraplex_garmi_demo``)
does, recorded for the viewer.

The world is the apartment's MuJoCo scene with its furniture annotated by the world
reasoner, the bowl and the spoon from coraplex's object meshes, and CRAM's GARMI. The
demo finds GARMI, the bowl and the spoon with entity queries; each transport leaves
where GARMI stands and how it grasps open, and the plan grounds them by a query when it
reaches them. With ``--step-queries`` each of these queries is a query step.

Needs ROS 2 with the ``iai_garmi_apartment`` and ``garmi_description`` packages built,
since the scene and the robot are read from their share directories.
