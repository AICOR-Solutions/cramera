"""
How a plan's motions are executed: kinematically simulated, or against a physics
simulation of the world in MuJoCo.

A generated plan demo runs the same plan whichever way it is executed; only the
execution differs, as the plan builder's run mode and the robot profile choose it by an
:class:`~cramera_protocol.robot_profile.ExecutorKind`. An execution sets the world up
for its kind while the plans run, and gives each plan the executor that runs it.

Executing on the real robot is another kind of execution: it starts Giskard to command
the robot, and the run's world is the one Giskard reports, kept in step with it.
