"""
Performing a plan: the world and the robot a task is performed with, and running one
plan node in a statechart of its own.

coraplex runs a plan as the top-level node of a cramph statechart, compiled and executed
by a plan executor whose context gives the nodes the robot and how statements are
grounded. A context serves one executor, so every plan performed gets a context of its
own, made from the :class:`TaskContext` it was built with: the one a plan was built in,
if it asked for one, else a new one.
