"""
``python -m cramera_bridge.arm_halt``: the plan builder's own halt of the real robot's
arms once it stopped a run, independent of the run, which may have been killed before it
could halt them.

Started as the plan builder asks the run to end, it reaches the arms' controllers while
the run ends and says so (:attr:`ArmHaltLine.READY`); once its input closes, which the
plan builder does after the run and its Giskard ended, and the operating system does
when the plan builder ends, it commands every arm's velocity controller zero velocities
and ends with status 0 only when a controller took them on every arm's topic and every
arm's driver then reports every joint standing still; the controllers take their
commands best effort, so their acknowledgement alone confirms little.
