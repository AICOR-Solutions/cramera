"""
Validating a plan before it runs on the robot: the performing robot's steps are grounded
one after another in a copy of the plan's twin, so nothing moves, and the report says
how each fared. A detection perceives where the robot's camera sees its region now,
through the robot's perception or that of its simulated scene, else it is assumed from
the twin. For the real robot, the twin's robot stands as the real one reports.

Run as ``python -m cramera_bridge.plans.validating <order.json> <report.json>``, it reads
a :class:`~cramera_protocol.validation.ValidationOrder` and writes the
:class:`~cramera_protocol.validation.ValidationReport`, so each validation has a process
of its own.
