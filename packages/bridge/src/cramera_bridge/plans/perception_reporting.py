"""
Writing a perception report to the run log for every detection a run's plans ran: what
the detection asked, every object RoboKudo reported for it and which one the step took.

RoboKudo's answers are read from its query action (see
:mod:`~cramera_bridge.plans.robokudo_answers`), since on the real robot the detections
ask from inside Giskard's process. A plan's detections run one after another and each
asks one query, so the n-th detection that ran in a plan asked the n-th query RoboKudo
accepted while the plan ran.
