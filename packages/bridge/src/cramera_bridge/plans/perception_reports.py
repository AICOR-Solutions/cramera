"""
Perception reports: what a step's perception query asked, every object the perception
reported, which one the step took and why it left the others, and the outcome in one
sentence a person reads beside the step.

The verdicts follow the rules a run applies: coraplex's RoboKudo client drops an object
of another color or type and one outside the box looked in, the detection takes the
first object left, and the step stops before moving when that object lies farther from
where the step expected it than the step allows. A step expects its objects where the plan
was validated with them, or, once it was planned again, where they were last seen.

What the perception checks, the type it names, is kept apart from what a person reads,
the object as the plan names it.
