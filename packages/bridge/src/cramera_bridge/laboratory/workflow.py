"""
A PR2 works through the small laboratory: it re-sorts the rack, stores a vessel in the
sample refrigerator and loads a balanced pair into the centrifuge, opening and closing
the refrigerator's door and the centrifuge's lid and driving between its stands at the
bench; the run is published, recorded and measured.

The measured outcome: every motion succeeds, every moved vessel was carried and set down
within a millimetre of its new slot, the refrigerator's door and the centrifuge's lid
were opened and are closed again, the vessel and the stopper the workflow does not move
stayed where they were, and the gripper's pads never cut into glass.
