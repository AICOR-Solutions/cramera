A PR2 moves a vessel from one rack slot to another with CRAM's pickup and placing, in
the laboratory as a CRAM world, while the run is published, recorded and measured.

The measured outcome: both actions succeed, the vessel was carried and lifted clear of
the rack, it was released into the target slot within a millimetre, the other vessels
and the stopper did not move, and the gripper's pads never cut into the glass.
