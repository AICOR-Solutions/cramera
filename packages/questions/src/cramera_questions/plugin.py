The viewer plugin answering questions about recorded scenes.

The plugin itself imports nothing of krrood or cramera-cram, so a viewer without the
CRAM workspace still loads it and serves its browser module; its routes are built from
:mod:`cramera_questions.routes`, which hands the questions to cramera-cram's question
engine, only where both are installed, and otherwise answer what is missing.
